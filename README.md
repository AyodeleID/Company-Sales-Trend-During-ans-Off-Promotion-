This is a company's sales data dashboard I built using the most powerful tool MS Excel.
• The sales trend during and off sales promo periods in the first 3 months of the year in 2022.
• The click-through rate (CTR) that measures the ratio of total impressions to clicks in search and display advertising, email marketing, and other online mediums
• A visualization showing how the company is keeping pace with sales target in the month.
